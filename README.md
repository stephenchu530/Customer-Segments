# Finding Customer Segments - Unsupervised Learning Project

A wholesale distributor had recently tested changes to their delivery method, but initial and scaled results show vastly different and negative results. In this project I applied various unsupervised learning techniques on the customer spending data to determine the customer segments. This data is then applied to an A/B test for the distributor to intelligently target their rollout of delivery method changes.

In this project, the following concepts were analyzed and implemented:
- Preprocessing of data including feature scaling and outlier detection/removal.
- Data scaling, transformation, and PCA dimension reduction.
- Cluster algorithm using Gaussian Mixture Model.
- Analysis and application of clustering results.
